# Introduction 
The Dover Forest is a young secondary forest that is found in the Ulu Pandan areas situated between three roads and the Ulu-Pandan canal. Similarly to the Clementi Forest (insert webpage to Clementi Forest here), the Dover Forest spontaneously afforested close to fifty years ago. A grass lawn divides the forest into two halves that locals in the area have nicknamed East Dover and West Dover Forest. As of July 2023, most of East Dover Forest has been deforested for redevelopment. While West Dover Forest remains intact for at least the next ten years, the attempt to protect the Dover Forest has been a story of hope and struggle for those who have dedicated their energy to protecting the forest and the species that live within it. 

# Histories of the Dover Forest
Little is known about Dover Forest’s land history during the pre-colonial to the colonial period. However, in more recent history, the land now known as the Dover Forest was once the Chua Kampung. Chua Chintat, an advocate of the Dover Forest, recalled that his family had all lived in the Chua Kampung. Though Chintat did not grow up in the kampung and had only visited a few times as a child, he recalled some of the origins of its people. 

>It started with my great-grandfather, he was directly from China, I’m not sure whether he was one of the founding dwellers of the kampung. The kampung started in 1905, my grandfather was also there right at the beginning, My surname is Chua, so this kampung was mostly people with the last name Chua, so they were from the province of Fujian. So a lot of the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia comes from Guangdong and Fujian cause that’s where the ships set sail from. So this kampung was mostly Chua’s from the town in Fujian so yeah if you are looking for any relics of the kampung, I don’t think there are any buildings left standing except for the kampung temple. That is still run by the temple trustees, so the temple caretakers live in that temple.

Slanted electric lines and brick steps that lead to nowhere can be found within the forest as artifacts of the Chua Kampung, living artifacts like the sea almond tree, or ketapang (insert link to sea almond tree wiki data here), inhabit the forest as reminders of the people who brought these seeds with them. 

# Found in the Forest
In its current form, the Dover Forest is home to a wide variety of species, native and non-native. As part of his advocacy for the Dover Forest, Chintat highlights the diverse tree and fig species of the Dover forest (insert link here). The Environmental Baseline Study for Dover/Ulu Pandan (EBS) (insert link here) listed twenty-seven large trees of significance within Dover Forest that are conservation-significant because of the potential of long-term ecosystem service provision by large tree species (e.g. thermal cooling, carbon sequestration, fauna habitat/food source).[^1] The Dover Forest is also home to a diversity of figs including the critically endangered White fig (insert wikidate link here) and non-native Indian rubber (insert wikidate link here). These figs are a keystone species in the Dover Forest ecosystem, providing important food resources for a wide range of species.[^2]

# Albizia Trees
Among this incredible diversity of species, the somewhat less popular non-native Albizia tree (Falcataria moluccana) sticks out as a popular nesting and breeding site for the residential changeable hawk eagles and oriental pied hornbills of the Dover Forest. The Albizia tree is globally well-known for its fast growth and nitrogen-fixing abilities. It was introduced into Singapore in the 1870s as a means of providing quick afforestation and shade given the species’ ability to grow a tall trunk rapidly.[^3] However, this rapid growth came at the cost of a thick trunk and deep roots making the tree species prone to falling or branch breakage, inducing in some members of the public “falling tree anxiety”.[^4] What was initially intended to be a quick solution to Singapore’s initial greening efforts soon became a hazard. However, residents of the Dover Forest like the Changeable hawk eagle and the Oriental pied hornbill, both native and endangered birds in Singapore, find the Albizia Tree to be a perfect setup to build their nests. 

The natural cavities in the Albizia tree offer the Oriental pied hornbill suitable breeding sites for their young. Citizen scientists have observed the residential male Oriental pied hornbill deliver fruits, insects, and lizards to his mate nesting in the hollow of an albizia tree in Dover Forest East (insert youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF9rE4SP5Ow&t=12s) between March and April of 2022. The residential changeable hawk eagles were also observed in a nest feeding and breeding at the canopy of an albizia tree in Dover Forest East for both breeding seasons in 2022 [^5] (insert youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhGI4novI0g) and 2023. The last eaglet of the Dover Forest nicknamed Snowy, has also been observed feeding and nesting in the nest on the Albizia tree (insert youtube link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbvOcBZCudQ). Both of these two species have also been observed interacting amongst the albizia trees (insert youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1RckgM_1w) revealing the ways that these two species potentially context within their respective nests in close proximity and with breeding cycles occurring over a similar period of time.[^6]

Habitats like the Dover Forest are crucial for the protection of species like the Oriental Pied Hornbill and the Changeable Hawk Eagle. Although species numbers have been on the rise in recent years for both species, there still lacks sufficient understanding of their vulnerability, habitat suitability, and prey density in the local context. A study done in 2011 counted six active nest sites and three pairs of eagles exhibiting pairing behavior, which rounded the local changeable hawk eagle population to nine pairs of eagles.[^7] This study did not include the pair observed in the Dover Forest, which would bring the local population to roughly ten pairs of eagles. As of July 2023, most of East Dover Forest has been deforested for new housing developments. Given that Snowy, the youngest member of the Dover Forest residents, had only hatched earlier this year, the Albizia tree on which the nest sits has remained intact for the rest of the year thanks to the advocacy of Chintat. However, the surrounding ecosystem that supported the growth of this eaglet has now been eradicated and one must wonder where they will find the food needed to continue feeding the eaglet. 

While the East Dover Forest is now essentially gone, the dedicated documentation of the species that once inhabited this forest shows us an example of the ways that non-native species like the Albizia tree offer valuable roosting and nesting sites for native species like the Oriental pied hornbills and changeable hawk eagles.[^8] Small patches of secondary forest in and around urban areas, like the Dover Forest, serve important ecological functions such as increased foraging ground, providing stepping stones for wildlife dispersal, and as habitats for resident species, especially endangered ones.[^9] As many of the Dover Forest advocates have already championed, there is significant value to the preservation of small secondary forests in Singapore.

I extend my gratitude to the Dover Forest advocates, residential bird-watchers, citizen scientists, photographers, and hikers that continue to document the Dover Forest.
